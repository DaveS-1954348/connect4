1. random player (illegal moves allowed) VS neural player (10 games)
neural player: 7 games (8x 4connect)
random player: 3 games (2x 4connect, 1x illegal move from opponent)
draw: 0 draws

overal notes:
the neural player has high predictions for the 4the piece of connect4, so learning training was good.
In many games he also won pretty early, meaning he actually uses a strategy and knows what he's doing.
Random player won many games by accident.
Illegal moves from the neural player are present but minimized.
